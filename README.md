# Heart Diseases Prediction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on various health-related features.



## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

 - data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
 - notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
 - docs: Documentation files related to the project.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is located in the 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/heart.csv' location. It includes various health-related features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors.
## Results
Details about the model's performance, evaluation metrics, and any visualizations can be found in the 'Heart Diseases Prediction.ipyb' directory.
